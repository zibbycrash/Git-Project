## Design Approach
| Requirement | My Implementation Idea |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Considering the design specifications, it's clear that the application runs only based on the Passenger sitting on the seat and switching on the heater system | Connecting the sensors of the two condtions to the Microcontroller. Implemented this using a `PIN CHANGE Interrput` to check if there is any change in these two sensor readings as they drive rest of the functionalities, and setting a flag to TRUE if both are satisfied |    
| Taking the ADC input Continuously as the user can opt to set the temperature at any time | Starting the ADC based on the set flag condition being TRUE. Then Handling rest of the features in `ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt` as if there is an ADC Conversion we need to perform the display and send data functions |
| Displaying the Input ADC values as PWM to the Oscilloscope | Intiazling the  Fast PWM Generation in 10-bit mode using Timer 1 inside the `ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt` as we need to display continuously. Setting the PWM Duty based on the range of ADC value |  
| Sending the Temperature set data serially | Implementing a USART protocol to serially transmit data based on the set temperature range done in the `ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt` as we need to display continuously based on user input | 

## Operation 

### Pin Configuration 

*   Using Atmega328 as the Microcontroller for implementing the Functionalities.
*   Pins and the peripherals connected to it

| PIN | Connected Peripheral | Direction of PIN |
|-----|----------------------|------|
| PIN B0 | LED Actuator (Indicator LED) | Output |
| PIN B1 | Pulse Width Modulation Wave | Output |
| PIN B3 | Sensor for Passenger Seated | Input |
| PIN B4 | Switch for Heating System | Input |
| PIN C0 | Set Temperature using ADC | Input |
