# Activity Diagram

An activity diagram is a behavioral diagram i.e. it depicts the behavior of a system. An activity diagram portrays the control flow from a start point to a finish point showing the various decision paths that exist while the activity is being executed.

I made the Activity diagram by using "StarUML" desktop app.

I am attaching both JPEG and pdf file.
