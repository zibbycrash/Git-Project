# Use Case Diagram

A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved

I made the use case diagram by using "StarUML" desktop app. 

I am attaching both JPEG and pdf of my Use Case.
