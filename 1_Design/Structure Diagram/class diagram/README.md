# Class Diagram

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling.

I made the class diagram by using "StarUML" desktop app.

I am attaching both JPEG and pdf file.
