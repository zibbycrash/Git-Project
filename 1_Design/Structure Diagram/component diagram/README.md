# Component Diagram

Component diagram is a special kind of diagram in UML. The purpose is also different from all other diagrams discussed so far. It does not describe the functionality of the system but it describes the components used to make those functionalities.

I made the component diagram by using "StarUML" desktop app.

I am attaching both JPEG and pdf file.
